# CAFE-MANAGEMENT-SYSTEM
The Café Management System is a software application designed to help café owners and staff manage daily operations more efficiently. Instead of doing tasks manually such as writing orders on paper, calculating totals, or tracking inventory this system automates the entire workflow, making the café faster, more organized, and easier to manage.
